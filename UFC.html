        <p>
            On October 6, 2018, a fight between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov took place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
            In the fourth round, Khabib Nurmagomedov submitted to win the contest and keep his UFC lightweight title.<br>
            Due to the two combatants' intense rivalry, which included a number of pre-fight events and personal insults, the battle was eagerly awaited. 
            McGregor was making his UFC comeback after a two-year absence, while Nurmagomedov was 26-0 and still unbeaten.<br>
            In the opening round, Nurmagomedov brought McGregor to the ground and held him there for the most of the fight. 
            In the second round, McGregor was able to avoid takedowns and successfully hit Nurmagomedov with several powerful blows. 
            Towards the conclusion of the round, Nurmagomedov was able to knock McGregor to the ground once more.<br>
            In the third round, Nurmagomedov maintained his ground advantage as McGregor seemed to be wearing out. 
            After more ground and pound in the fourth round, Nurmagomedov was able to take McGregor to the ground once more and use a neck crank submission to force McGregor to tap out.<br>
            During the fight, there was a post-fight incident in which McGregor's squad attacked Nurmagomedov both inside and outside the octagon, while members of Nurmagomedov's camp attacked McGregor.
            Overall, Nurmagomedov displayed his exceptional grappling abilities and ground control in a commanding performance. 
            The post-fight violence, however, cast a shadow on the triumph and resulted in penalties and suspensions for both the competitors and their crews.

    <h2> Masvidal vs Askren <br>
        UFC 239
    </h2>

<div class="description2">
    <p>
        On July 6, 2019, Ben Askren vs. Jorge Masvidal took place at UFC 239 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Masvidal knocked out his opponent in under five seconds to win the fight, 
        breaking the previous UFC record for the quickest knockout.<br>
        Masvidal lunged at Askren in the first few seconds of the bout, and Askren tried to wrestle him to the ground.
        Askren was knocked out cold and the fight was over in only five seconds thanks to a flying knee from Masvidal, who saw the move coming.<br>
        Given that Askren was regarded as one of the best wrestlers in the UFC and had previously gone unbeaten in his MMA career, the knockout was a stunning and unexpected way to end the fight. 
        Masvidal's flying knee quickly rose to prominence and was hailed as one of the greatest knockouts in UFC history.<br>
        The victory also elevated Masvidal to even greater notoriety and success in the UFC and solidified his place among the best competitors in the welterweight class. 
        Following the defeat, Askren announced his retirement from MMA, citing his concerns about his health and his desire to concentrate on other endeavours outside of the sport.<br>
